				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In April of 2015, Ashley and Brandon met at Lupe Tortilla while eating TexMex with mutual friends. The first of many notable queso experiences for the two, although perhaps the cheesiest, it was love at first sight. They went on their first date the next day, and the rest is history.</p>

				<p>Brandon proposed to Ashley on September 4th, 2016 after finishing the Disneyland Half Marathon together in California. A bystander quickly pointed out that long distance running is probably a really good metaphor for marriage, so feel free to insert your own pun about starting matrimony off on the right foot.</p>

				<p>Learn more about the Amala Foundation and their humanitarian work here.</p>

				<h2>Accommodations</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Ashley and Brandon have curated Airbnb listings for Austin near the venue. Airbnb is a great way to feel like a local in Austin, and is often much more cost effective than staying in a hotel. In general, if the listing is provided from a "Superhost," it is probably very good. Please contact Brandon or Ashley if you have any questions about location.</p>

				<p>If you're more into staying in a hotel, the South Congress Hotel and The Westin Austin Downtown are just a few of the many excellent hotels in located nearby.</p>

			<section class="section-faq container">
				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4>How do I get to Austin?</h4>
				<p>Drive, fly to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, or take a train to the Austin Amtrak station (1.2mi from the ceremony venue!).</p>

				<h4>Where do I park?</h4>
				<p>There is limited street parking on Gibson, 8th, and Treadwell Street. However, it is probably easier to park in the parking structure next to the Alamo Drafthouse across the street, or find street parking near the Mary Lee Foundation. Most street parking is free around the venue, however please do NOT park in front of the residential house next to the Sanctuary.</p>

				<h4>Austin doesn't have Uber or Lyft?!?</h4>
				<p>Don't panic. Ridesharing is still the best way to get around Austin. Download Fare, Fasten, or RideAustin. They all work very well and are functionally similar to Uber/Lyft.</p>

				<p>If you're parking downtown for any reason, ParkX is another great app to pay the meter from your phone</p>

				<p>Please remember to not drink and drive ♥</p>

				<h4>What's the attire?</h4>
				<p>Casual/festive attire.</p>

				<p>Please note that the dance floor is the foundation's yoga studio and most of the venue is outside; it is not recommended to wear stilleto-type heels if you plan on shaking your groove thang with us (which you should!). Flats, wedges, and wider heels are fine.</p>

				<h4>Will there be alcohol?</h4>
				<p>Beer and wine will be provided.</p>

				<h4>Are Brandon and Ashley going on a Honeymoon?</h4>
				<p>Absolutely! They're headed for the jungle-beach country, Belize.</p>
